## Disclaimer 📜
This project is a cool, independent venture, not affiliated with the AdGuard gurus. It's our little contribution to the vast internet cosmos. Use it wisely and at your own risk. 🌌

## Supported Lists 📚
We've got some neat lists for you:

- **Adult Content Blocklists** 🚫💔
  - Light list: `adguard_blocklist_adult_top1m.list` (~21k domains). A curated list targeting only the adult sites from the top 1 million sites out there.
  - Heavy list: `adguard_blocklist_adult_all.list` (~2 million domains). A hefty list. Heads up: This one's a bit heavy for the light-hearted!

Stay tuned for more list adventures! 🌍✨
