## Supported Lists 📚
We've got some neat lists for you:

- **Adult Content Blocklists** 🚫💔
  - Light list: `adguard_blocklist_adult_top1m.list` (~21k domains). A curated list targeting only the adult sites from the top 1 million cool sites out there.
  - Heavy list: `adguard_blocklist_adult_all.list` (~2 million domains). A hefty list with a touch of class, sourced from the brainy folks at Université Toulouse 1 Capitole. Heads up: This one's a bit heavy for the light-hearted!

Stay tuned for more list adventures! 🌍✨
